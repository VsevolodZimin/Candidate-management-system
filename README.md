This application was developed as a tool to simplify recruitment process in a company the real name of which was withheld for privacy reasons.
Caution: The programme was written before I learnt about the existence of Spring and Hibernate frameworks, so before looking at the code, please, take children and impressionable people away from the screen as what you are about to see is not for the faint of heart
You can find the complete runnable build of the programme in the "target" folder.
Thanks for reading:)
